# XYZshield

3 Axis CNC stepper motor driver shield for Arduino UNO.

https://github.com/grbl/grbl

This shield is intended to be used with the GRBL firmware on the arduino UNO. It came into exisitence due to a need to do away with the awful parrallel port interface that came with my chinese desktop CNC. With this shield I can now use my CNC without needing to dual boot into a 32bit OS and plug in a hefty parrallel port cable. Simply connect the USB cable and run the much nicer web based interface!

If you have bought one of these chinese CNC machines and would like to make the machine far more useable then a board like this is the way to go.
